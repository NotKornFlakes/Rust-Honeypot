//! # Stage 3: Protecting the logs
//!
//! Your logs hold IP addresses and passwords, so they need looking after. In this
//! stage the honeypot learns to:
//! - refuse to write to a log that other users can read
//! - start a new file each day, named by the date
//! - delete files older than `KEEP_DAYS`
//! - hide passwords and most of the IP address on screen
//!
//! The log files still hold the full details, because that's what your research needs.
//!
//! Do the exercises in order, replacing each `todo!()`. Run one exercise's tests with
//! `cargo test log_files::tests::ex1`. Run all of Stage 3 with `cargo test log_files`.
//!
//! `cargo run` crashes with "not yet implemented" until you've finished this stage,
//! because `main.rs` now uses this file.

// While the exercises are full of `todo!()`, some arguments, imports and other code
// aren't used, and the compiler warns about it. This line silences those warnings.
// Delete this comment and the line below once you've finished the stage.

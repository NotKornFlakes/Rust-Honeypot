//! # Stage 4: Many connections at once
//!
//! So far the honeypot has handled one visitor at a time, so one silent visitor holds
//! up everyone else. In this stage each visitor gets their own thread, and you add the
//! limits that stop anyone from overwhelming it once it's on the internet:
//! - one time limit for a whole visit, even for someone sending a letter at a time
//! - a cap on connections, both overall and for each IP address
//! - a daily budget for the log, so nobody can fill up the disk
//!
//! You'll also fix a gap from Stage 2: text sent without a newline is now kept when
//! someone goes quiet.
//!
//! Do the exercises in order, replacing each `todo!()`. Run one exercise's tests with
//! `cargo test server::tests::ex1`. Run all of Stage 4 with `cargo test server`.
//!
//! `cargo run` crashes with "not yet implemented" until you've finished this stage,
//! because `main.rs` now uses this file.

// While the exercises are full of `todo!()`, some arguments, imports and other code
// aren't used, and the compiler warns about it. This line silences those warnings.
// Delete this comment and the line below once you've finished the stage.

/// EXERCISE 9: accept one connection and handle it on its own thread.
///
/// The new idea is starting a thread. It's like `threading.Thread(target=...)` in Python,
/// and JS has nothing quite like it. `move` hands the closure ownership of everything it
/// uses, because the thread might outlive this function:
///
/// ```text
/// thread::Builder::new().spawn(move || {
///     // this runs on the new thread
/// })?;
/// ```
///
/// Unlike plain `thread::spawn`, this gives you an error instead of crashing if the
/// computer can't start another thread.
///
/// Do these in order:
/// 1. `listener.accept()`, as in Stage 2, and get the address with `peer.ip()`.
/// 2. `match` on `Slot::try_take(&shared.limits, ip)`.
/// 3. If there's no slot, call `shared.note_refused()`. Rust closes the connection for
///    you, because `stream` goes away at the end of this function.
/// 4. If there is one, make `let shared = shared.clone();` for the thread, and start it.
/// 5. In the thread, write `let _slot = slot;` and call `handle_visit`.
/// 6. Finish with `Ok(())`.
///
/// Hint: `let _slot = slot;` looks pointless, but it moves the slot into the thread, so
/// the place stays taken until the visit ends. Don't shorten it to `_`, which wouldn't
/// move it.

//! # Stage 2: Structured logs
//!
//! In Stage 1 you logged plain text, and only when a login finished. Here you build
//! a `Visit`: one line of JSON for every connection, whatever happened. That includes
//! visitors who connect and leave without typing, which Stage 1 missed.
//!
//! A log line looks like this, with `time` in seconds since 1970:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"time":1761935000,"source_ip":"127.0.0.1","outcome":"left","username":null,"password":null}
//! ```
//!
//! Do the exercises in order, replacing each `todo!()`. Stage 1 also has tests named
//! `ex1`, `ex2` and so on, so add `visit::tests::` to run just this stage's test:
//! `cargo test visit::tests::ex1`. Run all of Stage 2 with `cargo test visit`.
//!
//! `cargo run` crashes with "not yet implemented" until you've finished this stage,
//! because `main.rs` now uses this file.

// While the exercises are full of `todo!()`, the function arguments and some imports
// aren't used, and the compiler warns about it. This line silences those warnings.
// Delete this comment and the line below once you've finished the stage.
